In this lab, we have developed a program for the estimation of the position of an isolated emitter as part of the PALM microscopy method.

For this purpose, after a proper mathematical modelization of our noisy signal, we defined and expressed the Cramer Rao lower bound (CRLB) and its variation with respect to the parameter θ, to demonstrate the relation between the estimator’s variance and the CRLB, where estimator’s efficiency depends on the estimated value itself, θ. In the second part of this labwork, we have estimated the parameter using the function fminsearch in Matlab, and it showed that for a gaussian additive signal the estimator is efficient and not biased and it gave a good estimation of our parameter using the MonteCarlo simulation
